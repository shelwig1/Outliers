#pandas practice
import pandas as pd

dataframe = pd.DataFrame(columns = ['workObj'])
print(dataframe.head(5))

#saving and loading dataframes



#date object


#time worked


#dataframe will be in order, right? we just need to be able to fuck with previous dates?


#what is the not dumb way to do this



#I input the date
#I input the time
#that block of information is saved
#computer prints list of the last rolling week with time worked
